    <td>This architecture is proposed by john von-neumann. Now a day’s computer we are using are based on von-neumann architecture. It is based on some concepts.

      The memory we have a single read/write memory available for read and write instructions and data. 
      When we talk about memory, it is nothing but the single location which is used for reading and writing 
      instructions for the data and instructions are also present in it. Data and instructions are stored in a single read/write memory within the computer system.
      
      Each memory has multiple locations and each location has a unique address. We can address the contents of memory by its location
       irrespective of what type of data and instructions are present in the memory, because of which we can read or write any data and instructions.
        Execution always occurs in a sequential manner unless the change is required. 
        For example, suppose we are executing an instruction from line 1 to line 10 but now we required to execute 
        line 50 instead of line 11 then we jump to instruction 50 and execute it.</td>
    <td>To make up the architecture, instruction set architecture is needed because it has a set of instructions that the processor understands.
       It has two instruction set one is RISC (reduced instruction set computer) and the second is CISC (complex instruction set computer).

      Reduced instruction set computer architecture was realized in the 90’s by IBM. Instruction has multiple address modes,
       but programs do not use all of them that is the reason multiple address modes were reduced. This helps the compiler to easily write the instructions, 
       performed is increased.
      
      Complex instruction set architecture is the root of compilers because earlier compilers were not there to write programs,
       to ease programming instructions are added. The best performance is obtained by using simple instruction from ISA.</td>
    <td>Microarchitecture is known as computer organizations and it is the way when instruction set architecture is a built-in processor.
       Instruction set architecture is implemented with various microarchitecture and it varies because of changing technology.

      Microarchitecture performs in a certain way.
       It reads the instruction and decodes it, will find parallel data to process the instruction and then will process the instruction and output will be generated.
      
      It is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers. Some architectures overlap multiple instructions while executing but this does not happen in microarchitecture.
       Execution units like arithmetic logic units, floating-point units, load units, etc are needed and it performs the operation of the processor. 
      There are microarchitecture decisions within the system such as size, latency, and connectivity of the memories.</td>
