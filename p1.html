Computer architecture is a specification describing how hardware and software technologies interact to create a computer platform or system. 
When we think of the word architecture, we think of building a house or a building.
 Keeping that same principle in mind, computer architecture involves building a computer and all that goes into a computer system. 
 Computer architecture consists of three main categories.
System design 
Instruction set architecture 
Microarchitecture
